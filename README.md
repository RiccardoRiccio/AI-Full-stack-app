# AI Toolkit Pro

AI Toolkit Pro is a full-stack application that offers a range of AI functionalities such as Text-to-Image conversion, Article Summarization, and a Custom Chatbot. The application is seamlessly integrated with Stripe for premium feature access, positioning it as a ready-to-launch business application with built-in monetization capabilities.

(I tried to rebuild a project of codewithantonio without watching the video tutorial, and I added other features like a customizable chatbot with a knowledge base)
